### To Use This Repo

In order to use this repo you will need to create two separate .env files, `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Add these filenames to the .gitignore file to ensure they aren't pushed to GitHub.
